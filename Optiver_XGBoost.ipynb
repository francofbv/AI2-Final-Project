    "XGBoost (short for Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of the ever so popular gradient boosting algorithm. It is a powerful, flexible ML algorithm used a lot when data is presented in a tabular form. It has become infamous in ML competitions and tasks all over the world because of its great performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines a set of weak learners into a strong learner to minimize training errors. As it is an ensemble learner that means boosting methods are made up of base learners (weak learners), or models, who all work collectively to achieve a better prediction. Base learners on their own can't achieve good performance but aggregating all the base learners can yield to greater model performance. It learns sequentially by fitting a model then gathering its errors, followed by another model and the process repeats. Essentially, you are building multiple models (typically of the same type) where each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the sequence of models. You can think of a boosting method as a model of models.\n",

    "Gradient Boosting is the framework XGBoost is built on. Gradient boosting learners train themselves on residual errors of the previous predictors. It aims to optimize a loss function (that is differentiable) with gradient descent, that's where the \"gradient\" in gradient boosting comes into play. For our purposes, we are using it for a regressive task so an example loss function can be the squared errors/residuals. Since it is a boosting algorithm, its base learners of choice are decision trees. More specific to our case, regression trees that are used to output real values for splits and whose output can be added together, allowing subsequent models to be added and \"correct\" the residuals in the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with using decision trees as the weak learners is that they tend to be constructed in a \"greedy\" manner. This means they choose their best split points based on purity scores or to minimize the loss. This can make them very flexible but at the same time over-fit to the training data. The decision trees may also grow to be very large in size adding much more computational cost to fitting multiple models. Luckily, many gradient boosting implementations have found solutions to fix the over fitting and \"greedy\" nature of the algorithm. This includes constraining the trees by having maximum number of layers, depth, nodes, splits, or leaf nodes. Another way to fix this is to penalize the weights by using L1, L2, or a combination of the two (called Elastic-Net) regularization techniques. Since gradient descent is part of the algorithm, you can also tweak it by changing the learning rate or use a stochastic gradient as opposed to a \"full\" gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "What results is a boosting algorithm that is powerful, flexible, yet can perform well with new data coming into it. So, why the need for XGBoost? Well, the main reason most point to is performance. XGBoost is much more efficient than traditional gradient boosting. It allows users to hyper tune many different parameters for learning, regularization, tree pruning, all in one package. With gradient boosting, these processes are still possible, but they need to be implemented separately, meaning the improvements to over fitting and generalization don't come standard. Where XGBoost shines is the way it computes its base learners. It leverages parallel processing techniques which is ideal for large-scale datasets. Additionally, feature importance scores are something XGBoost calculates which can help in generalization. Finally, one big benefit XGBoost has is its innate ability to model even if there is missing data. According to the documentation, \"XGBoost supports missing values by default. In tree algorithms, branch directions for missing values are learned during training.\"  Objectively, both methods tout the same benefits as far as learning goes. Yet, its XGBoost that is gaining popularity due to its efficiency and ease of use for any size data set.\n"

We then will look at the features scores and see if we can spot a pattern in the features that XGBoost is trying to highlight. Afterwards, we will use PCA on the feature matrix. Again, looking for patterns to see what is explaining more of the variance in the data. Then, we will fit XGBoost on a different numbers of principal components to see if XGBoost gets better model performance or generalization with a smaller number of features. After that, we will feature engineer and baseline model the new design matrix with the new features.\n",

As we can see, the model is more reliant on the sizes of amount matched and unmatched at the reference price for predictive power. It also take into account the reference, bid, and ask prices as powerful assets. The bid/ask size and imbalance_buy_sell_flag are among the weaker features. As expected, seconds_in_bucket is a powerful feature as movement should be more intense as the final moments of the trading day come to a close."

You see each principal component in PCA is a weighted linear combination of the original features, where the loadings (weights) indicate how much each feature contributes. The magnitude of a loading reflects the strength of a feature’s influence on that component, regardless of direction. By sorting the absolute values of these loadings, you can identify which features have the greatest impact on the structure of each principal component, making it easier to interpret what each component represents.

As far as the window I would do my rolling statistics in, I decided on using the same window sizes as ChunhanLi used of 3, 6, 18, and 36.

    "To hypertune our XGBoost model, we have a multitude of parameters to choose from. Here's a list of what we will hypertune in our model (the descriptions are paraphrased from the documentation):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Controls the number of trees built while modeling. Too low and it will underfit, too high and it will overfit. Default value is 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of regressor trees. Increasing this will make the model more complex and more likely to overfit. Default value is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `eta`: The learning rate (step size) shrinkage used in update to prevent overfitting. It shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative. Default value is 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `min_child_weight`: Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needing in a child node. The larger it is, the more conservative the algorithm will be. Default value is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `subsample`: Subsample ratio of training instances. Setting it to 0.5 means that XGBoost would randomly sample half of the training data prior to growing trees. Helps with overfitting. Default value is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lambda`: L2 regularization term. Default value is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `alpha`: L1 regularization term. Default value is 0.\n",

    "There are many more but we want to make sure the hypertuning finishes in a reasonable amount of time as well."
